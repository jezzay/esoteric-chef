Below is a recipe for the esoteric programming language [Chef](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/chef.html)

It roughly implements a program that prints out a speech by [Count von Count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_von_Count)

# Recipe

```
Count von Count's Spicy Soup Challenge

The challenge sees how many rounds of Count von Count's Spicy Soup you can consume.

At each round, another Ghost Pepper is added. 

This recipe takes a number of Ghost Peppers (1-9), and prints out the following for each round of the challenge:

"<number>, uh, uh uh" 

For example, taking 3 rounds of Ghost Peppers would print:

 1, uh, uh uh
 2, uh, uh uh
 3, uh, uh uh

Simmer the Ghost Peppers
